# Time_Series
Time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis. Time series data means that data points are in a temporal sequence. This type of data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over a period.

Here are some of the key concepts and tools used in time series analysis:

1. Trends: A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. It does not have to be linear. Sometimes we will refer to a trend as “changing direction” when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend.

2. Seasonality: A seasonal pattern exists when a time series is affected by seasonal factors such as the time of the year or the day of the week. Seasonality can be seen in airline passenger data, for example, which typically increases during the holiday seasons.

3. Cyclicity: Data that shows cyclicity does not have a fixed period. That is, the fluctuations are not of fixed frequency, unlike seasonality.

4. Stationarity: This is an important characteristic of time series. A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time. Most statistical models assume that the time series is stationary.

5. Autocorrelation: Autocorrelation is the correlation of a time series with a lagged version of itself. For example, an autocorrelation of order 3 returns the correlation between a time series and its own values lagged by 3 time points.

6. Forecasting: This is arguably the most important use of time series analysis. It's about predicting the future as accurately as possible given the past data.

7. Decomposition: This involves thinking of a series as a combination of level, trend, seasonality, and noise components.

For time series analysis, various tools and software are used, such as R (packages like forecast, tseries, etc.), Python (libraries like statsmodels, pandas, etc.), Tableau, Excel, SAS, and SPSS, among others.
